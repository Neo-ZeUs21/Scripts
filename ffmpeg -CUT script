    Open a text editor and create a new file. You can name it something like cutvideo.sh.

    Add the following lines to the script:

bash

#!/bin/bash

if [ $# -ne 3 ]; then
    echo "Usage: $0 input_video.mp4 start_time end_time"
    exit 1
fi

input_file="$1"
start_time="$2"
end_time="$3"

output_file="${input_file%.mp4}-CUT.mp4"

ffmpeg -i "$input_file" -ss "$start_time" -to "$end_time" -c:v copy -c:a copy "$output_file"

    Save the file and exit the text editor.

    Make the script executable with the following command:

bash

chmod +x cutvideo.sh

Now, you can use the script as follows:

bash

./cutvideo.sh originalvideo.mp4 00:00:00 00:45:00

This command will cut the video "originalvideo.mp4" from 00:00:00 to 00:45:00 and save the output as "originalvideo-CUT.mp4." You can modify the start and end times as needed for different video cuts.

If you want to use an alias instead of a script, you can add the alias to your .bashrc or .bash_aliases file. Open one of these files and add the following line:

bash

alias ffm='./cutvideo.sh'

Save the file, and then you can use the alias like this:

bash

ffm originalvideo.mp4 00:00:00 00:45:00

This will have the same effect as running the script directly.
